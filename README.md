# Procedual-Geometry
Library of procedural geometry routines
First title in this library:  Procedural cube mesh.  

Input: n = number of verticies on the edge of the cube.

Output: 12n² triangles( 36n² vertices )in sequence, in a data structure ready for rendering

See CompositeCube.png for the algorithm and formulae of this routine.
